          <h4>My Career</h4>
          <p>As I said I would want to go into web development. I would still live in the USA. To be honest I hate New York, so I have no idea where to go. I would probably travel by public transport if in a city or in a car if I lived in a rural area. As for amenities I would probably have a gym membership, phone and tv services. I would buy and cook food and shop once a week. I have no plans for family, I am 15 and I can't even add properly. A dog would be cool though.</p>
